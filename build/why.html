            <p>Have you ever wanted to say something, and even though you had opportunity to express it, you knew that moment wasn't the best moment to do so? Whether it was because it would interrupt a different conversation, or distract from something, or some other reason - that doesn't mean that the thing you wanted to say wasn't worth saying at all.</p>
            <p>"So say it later!" myself would exclaim. "But when later?" I would ask myself... I don't like making decisions, but I do like making complicated systems to make decisions on my behalf, so I made this.</p>
            <p>This isn't a tool for sending hushed messages that you don't want to talk about - on the contrary, it is a tool to re-open a door at a later time for a conversation about something that, in the moment, you were not able to explore as deeply as you wanted to. Or, a means of attempting to remove the pressure of instant feedback. In a way, it is a attempting to duplicate in a digital model some of my favorite properties of a physical letter.</p>
            <p>I use this with <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9214606?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">schedule send</a> in Gmail to email things to myself or others.</p>
            <p>I can't say why anyone else would want to use this though.</p>
